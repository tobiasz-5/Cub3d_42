Cub3D is a 3D game project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It utilizes raycasting to render a 3D environment based on 2D grid maps, similar to classic games like Wolfenstein 3D [1992].

Raycasting: Simulates 3D perspective by projecting rays from the player's viewpoint to determine visibility and depth.<br/>
MinilibX: Uses the MinilibX library for graphics rendering and window management.<br/>
Event-Driven Programming: Implements event handling for user input, allowing for real-time interaction and control.<br/>
Texture Mapping: Applies textures to walls (and other items) for enhanced visual realism.

This project provides a practical introduction to graphics programming and game development through the implementation of raycasting techniques.
